# Configuration System Restructuring

## Overview

The configuration system has been restructured to improve maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns. The previous monolithic `config.py` file has been split into multiple modules within a new `config` package.

## New Structure

```
src/core/config/
├── __init__.py          # Package entry point, maintains backward compatibility
├── models.py            # Dataclasses for configuration models
├── loader.py            # Environment variable loading and settings creation
├── validator.py         # Configuration validation logic
└── utils.py             # Utility functions
```

## Module Responsibilities

### models.py
Contains all the dataclasses that define the structure of the configuration:
- `AppSettings` - Root application settings
- `TelegramSettings` - Telegram client settings
- `PathSettings` - File and directory paths
- `LiteLLMSettings` - LiteLLM client settings
- `SynthesisSettings` - Knowledge synthesis settings
- `RAGSettings` - RAG pipeline settings
- And other related settings classes

### loader.py
Handles loading configuration from environment variables:
- `get_settings()` - Main function to load all settings
- Environment variable parsing
- JSON configuration parsing for complex structures

### validator.py
Contains validation logic for configuration values:
- Range checks for numerical values
- Warning messages for potentially problematic settings
- Required field validation

### utils.py
Utility functions used across configuration modules:
- `get_project_root()` - Determines the project root directory

## Backward Compatibility

The original `src/core/config.py` file has been updated to import from the new package structure, maintaining full backward compatibility. All existing imports will continue to work without modification.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Better Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect of configuration don't affect others
4. **Clearer Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
5. **Easier Debugging**: Issues can be traced to specific modules more easily
